### Clicker Slayer
---

Clicker Slayer is a game application based on the clicker genre, inspired by similar games like Cookie Clicker but with mechanics and a game loop based on the Monster Hunter series.

The main objective of the game is to clear all the areas of the map and defeat the final enemy of the abyss. To do so, the player will need to make use of their abilities, make contracts with different kinds of units, and upgrade the level of their weapons.

To see a demo of the game, I recommend checking out this video I made showing the main mechanics and gameplay:

If you want to try the game yourself, I included an APK in the repository so everyone can try it on their phone.

Clicker Slayer is a project that I made for fun, and everyone can use it to learn and modify it, but I reject any commercial uses of the project.
